INFO:__main__:Received response from OpenAI: Sure! The moon's surface is like a big, rocky playground! It has lots of craters from space rocks, like bumps and holes. There are also smooth, dark areas called "maria," which means "seas," even though they're not water. It's super cool to explore, isn't it?
